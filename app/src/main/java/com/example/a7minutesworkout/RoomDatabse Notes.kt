There are three major components in Room:

1-> The database class that holds the database and serves as the main access point for the underlying
 connection to your app's persisted data.

2-> Data entities that represent tables in your app's database.

3-> Data access objects (DAOs) that provide methods that your app can use to query, update, insert, and
delete data in the database.
